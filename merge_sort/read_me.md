# **Merge sort algorithm for sorting the arrays**

**_input_**: an array of length n, for example [1,4,6,2,3,5]

**_output_**: sorted array [1,2,3,4,5,6]

_The algorithm works on divide and conquer strategy, i.e. it devides the main problem in subproblems and based on the outcomes of those subproblems it comes to the overall outcome of the problem_
