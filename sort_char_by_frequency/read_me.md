# **Sort a string based on the frequency of characters**

**_Description_**:Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.
Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**_input_**: string for e.g. 'tree'

**_output_**: sorted string 'eetr'


**_Explanation_**: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
